Welcome to Pymprovisator.

Pymprovisator is a helper program for jazz musicians.
It generates and plays a MIDI file based in your songs
settings (tempo, style, measures, chords, ...).
The program is inspired in PG Music's Band in a Box and 
the book+CD sets from Jamey Aebersold.

This program is free software, GPL licensed, see the file LICENSE.TXT
